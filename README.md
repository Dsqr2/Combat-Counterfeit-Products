# Combat-Counterfeit-Products
# Combatting Counterfeit Products with Blockchain

## Overview

This project aims to leverage Blockchain technology to combat the pervasive issue of counterfeit products in the market. Blockchain ensures transparency, traceability, and security across the supply chain, enabling a robust solution against counterfeit goods.

## Features

- **Immutable Records:** Blockchain ensures that once data is recorded, it cannot be altered, providing an immutable history of product transactions.

- **End-to-End Traceability:** Every step in the supply chain is securely recorded on the blockchain, allowing stakeholders to trace the journey of a product from manufacturing to delivery.

- **Smart Contracts:** Automated smart contracts enforce predefined rules, ensuring authenticity checks at each stage of the supply chain, reducing the risk of counterfeit infiltration.

- **Decentralized Database:** Eliminate single points of failure with a decentralized database, making it significantly harder for counterfeiters to manipulate data.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git`
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`

2. **Usage:**
   - Run the application: `npm start`
   - Access the blockchain dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Configuration:**
   - Adjust smart contract rules in `config.js` for specific product authenticity checks.
